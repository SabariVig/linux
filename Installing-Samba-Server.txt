Step 1 : Install samba packages after updating repositories

#	apt-get update

#	apt-get install samba samba-common python-glade2

Creating Yours share

Step 2 : Create folder for Your share.

#	mkdir -p /shares/ahmadshare

Step 3 : Change the ownership to nobody so that everyone can access and store files in that folder.

#	chown nobody:nogroup /shares/ahmadshare/

Step 4 : Now define values in samba configuration to share/shares/anonymous/folder. /etc/samba/smb.conf is the main configurion file for samba .
Take a backup before editing that file .

#	cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.org

now add the below code at the end of the file to enable share.

#	vim /etc/samba/smb.conf

[Anonymous]
       comment = ahmad share access
       path = /shares/ahmadshare
       browsable = yes
       writable = yes
       guest ok = yes
       read only = no
       force user = nobody
       force group = nogroup

Step 5 : Now restart smbd service .

#	service smbd restart

Accesing Samba Share from Your Windows Machine

On your windows go to Start->run->//your_host_ip



Click ok








Creating secured share


Secured shares can be accessed using username and password .Here for example, I'm going to create share ahmadsecured.
Step 6 : Create a folder for share .

#	mkdir -p /shares/ahmadsecured

Step 7 : Create a new group secureshare,so that Users added to this group can access project1 share.

#	addgroup secureshare

Step 8 : Modify ownership and permission for the folder.
Create a new group secureshare,so that Users added to this group can access ahmadsecure share.

#	mkdir -p /shares/ahmadsecured

#	chown root:secureshare secured/

#	chmod 770 /shares/ahmadsecured/

Step 9 : Now define values in the configuration file .

#	vim /etc/samba/smb.conf

[ahmadsecured]
         comment = secure Share
         path = /shares/ahmadsecured
         valid users = @secureshare
         guest ok = no
         writable = yes
         browsable = yes


Step 10 : Now restart smbd service .
#	service smbd restart


After restarting service, you could see ahmadsecured share . Additional secured shares can be created in the same way

Add new user you want to use for samba share on your system

#	adduser ahmad -G secureshare

#	adduser ahmad

#	adduser ahmad secureshare

#	smbpasswd -a ahmad


On your windows go to Start->run->//your_host_ip


       
       
       Click OK
       
       
       
       Double Click on Your SecuredShare
       Give your username and  pass
