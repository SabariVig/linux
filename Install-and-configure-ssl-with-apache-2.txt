Configure Apache to Use the SSL Certificate:
Now all the certificates are ready. The next thing to do is to set up the Apache to display the new certificate.

Install apache webserver
#	apt-get install apache2 -y
For this, you need to enable SSL support on the Apache default virtual host file located in the /etc/apache2/sites-enable/ directory.
By default, Openssl is installed in Ubuntu 14.04. This module provides SSL support to Apache. It is disabled by default, so you need to enable the SSL module first.
You can enable the SSL module by running:
sudo a2enmod ssl
After you have enabled SSL, you'll have to restart the Apache service for the change to be recognized.
sudo service apache2 restart

You can do this by editing the Apache default virtual host config file.
sudo nano vim /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

Comment out all the lines by adding a "#" in front of each line and add the following lines:

<VirtualHost *:443>
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                DocumentRoot /var/www/html
                ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
                SSLEngine on
                SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.crt
                SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.key
</VirtualHost>

Save and close the file, then restart Apache.
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
This should enable your new virtual host which will serve encrypted content using the SSL certificate you created.
