Step 1. Install server.
Well that is obvious:
#	sudo apt-get install vsftpd

Step 2. Configure server
Now, open /etc/vsftpd.conf:
#	vim /etc/vsftpd.conf

Set/uncomment the following params as shown below
# Disallow anonymous, unidentified users to access files via FTP; change the anonymous_enable setting to NO:
anonymous_enable=NO
# Allow local uses to login by changing the local_enable setting to YES:
local_enable=YES
# If you want local user to be able to write to a directory, then change the write_enable setting to YES:
write_enable=YES
# Local users will be 'chroot jailed' and they will be denied access to any other part of the server; change the chroot_local_user setting to YES:
chroot_local_user=YES

chroot_list_enable=NO
chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
# Allow users to write to their root directory
allow_writeable_chroot=YES

Step 3 Change the permission on the files/and folder you want to share

#	chmod a-w /home/ahmad


#	mkdir /home/ahmad/files


#	chown ahmad:ahmad /home/ahmad/files
